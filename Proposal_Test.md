# Exploring Hotel Demands

## Analysis on hotel demands isn't particularly exciting from the offset. What I hope to encourage in this analysis is a more holistic and nuanced hotel analysis framework that could lead to significantly increased revenues. What makes hotels a great area of focus is the elasticity of the market due to "close-proximity" marketing. The term close-proximity is to explain the way the consumer and the purchase are in direct interaction with each other such as what you get with mom and pop shops. The product you are purchasing is also where you are purchasing it from. When establishments such as these are able to reach you on a more personalized level, we tend to take responsibility as a consumer to their product's success. This is a marketing opportunity gap that can be exploited and is a more available option with the small-chain hotels with a working class demographic. Through a broad set of analyses, starting with this analysis, I hope to assist hotels in converting from a business model into a personalized, human-to-human, sociological experience.
