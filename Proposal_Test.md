# Exploring Hotel Demands

## Analysis on hotel demands assists in the short and long term decisions hotels can aim to implement for their business. Understanding these trends can give hotels a better opportunity to meet their customer's needs. It is apparent that the levels of demands can alter how a hotel may run its operations from staffing to the amenities that they offer. Furthermore, it affects the revenue in the city significantly just based on a singular event. Which has a ripple effect onto future dated events that boosts hotel profits with less money spent.

## In exploring our hotel demands data we want to recognize variables that can set a higher confidence that the booked rooms will not be cancelled. To do this we will look at variables such as length of stay, repeat guest, cancelled prior bookings and method of booking. The dataset that is being used allows me to capture key indicators to test my hypothesis.
