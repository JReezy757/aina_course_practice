# Exploring Hotel Demands

## What makes hotels a great area of focus is the elasticity of the market due to "close-proximity" marketing. The term close-proximity is to explain the way the consumer and the purchase are in direct interaction with each other such as what you get with mom and pop shops. The product you are purchasing is also where you are purchasing it from. When establishments such as these are able to reach us on a more personalized level, we tend to take responsibility as a consumer to their product's success. This is a marketing opportunity gap that can be exploited and is a more available option with small-chain hotels that cater to a working class demographic. There are further sets of analyses we would want to observe. In this analysis, we start with observing key indicators in our dataset that can emphasize patterns in reservation cancellations. More holistically, the different analyses that can be observed will usher in a personalization market
