# EDA for Hotel Booking Conversions; 3rd Party to Direct

## In exploring this hotels dataset, I would like to look at whether there is an increase or decrease in revenue by converting 10% of 3rd party bookings into direct bookings (my hypothesis is that it is significant of thousands more per month for hotels that are equal to 100 rooms or less). Then, I would like to know by how much is this difference and show with a visualization.
